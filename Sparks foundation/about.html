                <p style ="text-align: centre;">We are the non-profit making, voluntary, service-oriented/development oriented organization, 
                either for the benefit of members (a grassroots organization) or of other members of the population
                (an agency).As non-profit organizations, NGOs rely on a variety of sources for funding projects, operations, 
                salaries and other overhead costs. Because the annual budget of an NGO can be in the hundreds of millions 
                (or even billions) of dollars, fundraising efforts are important for the NGO's existence and success..
